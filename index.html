    <p>Instructor Claudio Sidi is the GURU of the DevOps. He is teaching us many ways of improving our knowledgedes in the AWS cloud domain.
       We will like you to trust the process as our Instructor Narcisse always says. Also, remember that answer of any question regarding the cloud will always depend of the use case per Instructor Idriss. 
       Great thanks to all Teacher Assistants (Hera, Dee, Alexandra...) for their time and skills in order to help us.
       We also encourage you to take your time do your homework. Thanks to all instructors and teacher assistants for the dedicated time and skills.
